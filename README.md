Music genre classification has been a difficult but promising task in the realm of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Due to the elusive nature of audio musical data, the effectiveness of any music genre classification system is dependent on its ability to extract usable and reliable features from audio signals. The performance of earlier timbral feature-based methods for categorizing the genres of audio music was constrained. We propose a method for extracting musical pattern characteristics from audio music using the MFCC technique and classify songs based on their genres using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a model that is frequently used in tasks involving image infor-mation retrieval. A robust recommendation system begins with the categorization of music genres. Sound processing is a huge research area through which we can find solutions to various med-ical or mental issues through music therapy solutions. There are various music appli-cations such as Spotify, Google Play, Apple Music, etc., but for implementation, one of the most important steps is to classify the genre nre of a song which requires audio pro-cessing, it is one of the most complex tasks that involve time signal processing, time series, spectrograms, spectral coefficients, and audio feature extraction to feed a neural network.
